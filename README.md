# RoboThings S3 Mini firmware

Xiaozhi AI voice assistant for the ESP32-S3 Super Mini Zero (4MB flash, 2MB PSRAM),
built from the open-source [xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) project
with a new board `robothings-s3-mini`.

## What is new

- **Animated robot eyes** on the 128x64 OLED: blink, look around when idle, grow
  attentive while listening, pulse while speaking, scan while connecting, and drift
  calmly in standby. Each AI emotion has its own face: happy, laughing, sad,
  crying, angry, surprised, love (heart eyes), thinking, confused, wink, cool.
- **Voice alarms and timers** (device-side MCP tools `self.alarm.*`):
  set once / daily / weekdays / weekends / chosen days, list, cancel, snooze, optional
  lamp-on with the alarm. Saved in flash, ring without internet. Stop it by saying the
  wake word ("Alexa") or pressing any button; each ring lasts 20 s.
- **Lamp relay** voice control (GPIO 12), as before.
- **Music from your own library**: run `tools/music-server/robothings_music_server.py`
  on a PC with your songs, then say "Alexa, Tum Hi Ho chalao". Saying "Alexa" pauses,
  the song resumes after the chat. Tools `self.music.*`.
- **India time (IST)** by default: the clock is synced from internet time (SNTP) and
  kept at UTC+05:30. Another zone can be set by voice (tool `self.clock.set_timezone`).

## Wake word

"Alexa" (ESP-SR model `wn9_alexa`). Another one can be chosen when running the
workflow manually (Actions -> Build RoboThings firmware -> Run workflow).

## Voice shortcuts and screen

Commands are recognised from their key words, so natural variations work.

- **"Bye", "Bye bye", "Goodbye", "Chup raho"**: the device goes to standby at once
  without a word: the speaker is muted the moment the words are recognised.
- **"So jao"**: the same, showing the sleeping eyes for a few seconds.
- **Main display mode** (saved, kept after a restart):
  - **Time mode**: "show time", "show me the time", "screen par time dikhao", "clock
    dikhao", "change the mode to time". The clock (`09 00`, always two-digit hours,
    no colon) stays on screen, also while talking.
  - **Emotion mode**: "show face", "show emotions", "emotions dikhao", "face dikhao",
    "change the mode to emotions". The animated eyes and emotions.
  - **"Change the mode" / "switch mode"** switches to the other one.
  - Alarms and setup screens take over the screen for a while and then hand it back to
    the chosen mode.
- **Theme** (saved): "light mode", "invert the screen", "make screen white", "screen ko
  light mode pe kardo" invert the panel; "dark mode", "turn off light mode", "screen
  dark karo" return to the default dark screen.
- **"Time format 12 hours / 24 hours pe kar do"**: switches the clock format (saved).
- **"Rone wala chehra dikhao", "Excited ho ke dikhao", "Gussa dikhao"...**: shows that
  expression (crying, excited, angry, in love, ...) with its own 4.5-second cute sound
  (happy, excited, sad, crying, angry, surprised, shocked, sleeping, in love, wink,
  blush, confused, thinking, annoyed, tease, curious, sweet), then standby.
- **"Sorry, I did not understand" replies** are cut after their first words and
  replaced by a short "hm?" chirp; listening goes on, so just say it again.
- **"Alexa" always gives the wake sound** and listens: from standby, while the
  assistant speaks (the reply stops at once) and while it is already listening.
- **Timers, Pomodoro and stopwatch are handled on the device** (no waiting for the AI):
  - "Set a timer for 10 minutes", "10 minute ka timer lagao": starts at once.
  - "Extend 10 minutes", "10 minute aur": more time (after a ring: a new timer of that
    length; while a timer runs: added to it).
  - "Stop" / "alarm band karo": stops the ringing alarm (also right after "Alexa"
    silenced it).
  - **Pomodoro**: "set Pomodoro timer" starts 25 min focus -> 5 min break -> 25 min
    focus ... Each period starts the next one by itself (the alarm only announces it).
    "Extend 10 minutes" adds time to the current period (focus or break). "Pause the
    Pomodoro" / "resume (continue) the Pomodoro" keep the period and its remaining
    time (the colon blinks while paused). "Stop Pomodoro" ends the session. The
    countdown is the screen while it runs (switch away with "show time" / "show face",
    back with "show timer"). The session survives a restart.
  - **Stopwatch** (counts up, MM:SS): "start stopwatch" (or "start the timer"),
    "pause stopwatch", "resume stopwatch", "stop / end stopwatch" (or "stop the
    timer"), "show stopwatch". The colon blinks while it is paused.
- **Alarms / timers**: each ring lasts 20 seconds. Only for an alarm or timer set an
  hour or more ahead (and repeating alarms): when nobody answers, a 10-minute snooze
  starts (its countdown shows on the screen) and then it rings again, three rings in
  all (the alarm and two snoozes). "Alexa, stop" during a snooze cancels it. Shorter
  ones just stop after their 20 seconds. Normal timers never start a Pomodoro break. Saying "Alexa" over the ring stops it and the device
  goes back to standby (timers keep listening, e.g. for "extend 10 minutes").
- **Command mode vs conversation**: after a device action through the AI (alarm,
  timer, lamp, screen...) the device goes back to standby once the reply is spoken;
  questions keep the conversation open for a follow-up.
- **Listening timeout**: when nobody speaks, the server's spoken goodbye is cut off
  and the device plays a short falling "done" beep (the wake sound in reverse) instead.
- **Interrupting**: "Alexa" while the assistant speaks stops the reply at once, plays
  the wake sound and listens. Wake word thresholds (wn9_alexa default 0.64): 0.45 while
  the device speaks or an alarm rings, 0.58 in standby.
- **Wake sound at once**: the popup plays the moment "Alexa" is detected, before the
  server connection opens.
- **"Show timer" / "show countdown" / "timer dikhao"**: shows the countdown of the
  shortest running timer, also while talking, until another mode is chosen. A timer
  under 31 minutes (e.g. "set a timer for 10 minutes", a Pomodoro) switches to its
  countdown by itself as soon as it is set.
- **Voice states (emotion mode)**, each with one face from the expression sheet:
  standby = big square eyes drifting slowly with relaxed blinks; wake word heard =
  Sweet; listening = Blush (also while the reply is prepared: no thinking face);
  speaking = Excited.
- **No text on the screen**: only the clock and countdown digits. Alarms, setup and
  notifications are shown with the eyes and sounds only (the activation code is read
  out loud).
- **"Alexa"** plays the short "popup" sound and listening starts at once, from
  standby and during a conversation; the wake word is not sent to the server, so there
  is no spoken greeting.

## Microphone, echo cancellation and alarms

- **Words said right after "Alexa" are kept**: the microphone keeps recording while the
  connection opens and that speech is sent first, so "Alexa, roo ke dikhao" in one
  breath reaches the server complete.
- **Echo cancellation**: the MAX98357A cannot feed its output back, so the firmware
  keeps a copy of what it plays (software playback reference) and the ESP-SR AFE
  removes the device's own sound from the microphone while it listens for the wake
  word. "Alexa" can then be heard over the alarm beep, music or the assistant's voice.
  It runs only while the device plays something (reply, alarm, music): it is the
  heaviest part of the audio front end and is not needed otherwise.
- **Alarms / timers**: the beep (about 1 s) repeats every 3 s and the wake word is more
  sensitive while it rings. Say "Alexa" (or press any button) to stop it.
- A clipping microphone (too loud / too close) is reported in the serial log.
- Speech-to-text itself runs on the server.

## Time

The device clock is synced from the internet and kept on IST. The AI is told to use
the `self.clock.get_time` tool for the time. For best results also add this line to
the role description on xiaozhi.me: *"The user lives in India (IST, UTC+5:30). For the
current time or date always call self.clock.get_time."*

## Wiring (unchanged from the original firmware)

| Part | Pin | ESP32-S3 |
|---|---|---|
| INMP441 mic | WS / SCK / SD | GPIO 4 / 5 / 6 (L/R to GND) |
| MAX98357A amp | DIN / BCLK / LRC | GPIO 1 / 2 / 3 (VIN 5V, SD to 3.3V) |
| SSD1306 OLED | SDA / SCL | GPIO 7 / 8 |
| Boot / talk button | | GPIO 0 |
| Hold-to-talk button | | GPIO 11 |
| Volume up / down | | GPIO 9 / 10 |
| Lamp relay IN | | GPIO 12 |
| Status LED | | GPIO 21 |

## Flashing

Open `index.html` from GitHub Pages (or any https host) in Chrome / Edge, or flash
manually with ESP Flash Download Tool (ESP32-S3, 4MB, DIO, 80MHz):

| File | Address |
|---|---|
| bootloader.bin | 0x0 |
| partition-table.bin | 0x8000 |
| ota_data_initial.bin | 0xd000 |
| xiaozhi.bin | 0x10000 |
| generated_assets.bin | 0x300000 |

`merged-binary.bin` contains all of them at 0x0.

Two builds are published: `firmware/` for 0.96" SSD1306 OLEDs and
`firmware-sh1106/` for 1.3" SH1106 OLEDs (most 1.3" I2C modules). The wrong one
shows a screen full of random dots.

The partition layout is the same as the original firmware, so the existing
GitHub Pages flasher works by replacing the five `.bin` files.

## First setup

1. Power on: the device opens a Wi-Fi hotspot `Xiaozhi-XXXX`.
2. Join it, open `http://192.168.4.1`, choose your Wi-Fi.
3. The OLED status line shows an activation code. Add the device on
   https://xiaozhi.me with that code. Set language, voice and personality there.
